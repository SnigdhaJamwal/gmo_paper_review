### REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY OF “LONG-TERM TOXICITY OF A ROUNDUP HERBICIDE AND A ROUNDUP-TOLERANT GENETICALLY MODIFIED MAIZE”

#### ABSTRACT
One of the most controversial topics in the advancement of the science of agriculture and genetics is the concept of genetic mutation, or GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms). This paper reviews and suggests improvements of the controversial republished paper “Long-term toxicity of a Roundup herbicide and a Roundup-tolerant genetically modified maize” by a French molecular biologist, Gilles-Eric Séralini which was a 720 day follow up study to Monsanto's 90 days study.  The paper concluded that the genetically modified NK603 maize and herbicide Roundup, manufactured by Monsanto and other similar agricultural edible GMOs and complete pesticide formulations must be evaluated thoroughly in long-term studies to measure their potential toxic effects. 
This paper shall shed light over the controversy and the limitations and differences between both studies, the one original 90 days study conducted by Monsanto and the follow up 720 days study conducted by Gilles-Eric Séralini. Then the paper reviews the criticisms faced by the follow up study to see if they had any merit and suggests remedial methods if necessary.

#### CONCLUSION

A.	Sample Size Estimation  
As is evident through the results obtained by the two-sample power t-test calculation, the size of each group in the experiment, as 10 was too small. For the results to be accurate and reliable, the desired number of rats in each group should have been a minimum of 26, that is, the overall sample should have contained a total of 520 rats consisting of 260 males and 260 females, assuming the effect size to be 0.8

B.	Graphical representation of deaths and tumors in various groups over time  
It can be noticed from the line charts plotted for number of deaths and tumours in male and female rats, that the number of deaths and tumours were seen to be higher in those groups that were fed genetically modified maize with and without RoundUp herbicide, as compared to the Control Isogen group.
However, this interpretation is not reliable because of the flaw mentioned earlier in the research model, that is, the small sample size.

C.	Drawbacks  
•	The effect size value used for calculation of the required sample size is meant to be selected by experiments and research that has been carried out in the past. The effect value was chosen to be 0.8, however there must be more research done as to whether or not it is the value most suited for this particular topic of research.  
•	The experiment, even after increasing the sample size, continues encountering the same problem of lack of enough control groups for the accurate comparison of number of deaths and tumours in the different groups of rats.

D.	Further Improvement and Research  
•	The most suited value of effect size must be further investigated and the studies conducted thereafter should have a sample size of at least 26 rats per group present in the study  
•	Once a suitable sample size is selected, the experiment can be assigned a research model using methods that ensure the validity of the study.
